# A Project in Integer Sequence Prediction

The data sets *train.csv* and *test.csv* come from Kaggle's Knowledge contest **Integer Sequence Learning** (https://www.kaggle.com/c/integer-sequence-learning), but they are based on the **On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences** (https://oeis.org/).  

INSERT ABSTRACT

In *integer_sequence_all.py*, the code (used in a report on the findings of my research) is openly available to anyone to use for their own projects.  I fully commented to help people new to sequence prediction and keras or HTM or genetic programming.  Images that are in the report are also included in this repository so that they can be viewed more clearly.  A description of what each image displays is below.
